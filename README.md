# Anomaly Detection and Classification in Power System State Estimation

This is a code repository for the paper [Power System Anomaly Detection and Classification Utilizing WLS-EKF State Estimation and Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12629) (arXiv:2209.12629)

Codes are developed in two different environment: Matlab and python.

In order to be able to run the Matlab code you must have matpower installed
The power flow has been done using OPF via matpower (version 7.0).
